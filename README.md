# Tumor-Detection

We have to predict whether a MRI image contains tumor or not. Dataset used to build the model is taken from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection'>Tumor Detection</a> and I am really grateful to the author for providing such a wonderful dataset.

Findings and method used to solve the task is given in the research report.
